# Neural Controller based Motion Planning
It is an extremely challenging task to design a control architecture for robots especially for the ones which are working in unpredictable environments. It is impossible to manually program every behavior in dynamic environments. Also such systems are not robust enough and may fail easily. Evolutionary Robotics is an experimental research field which aims at addressing these issues and develop robust autonomous robots which can be deployed in the real world by observing Biological Systems. Evolution is a powerful optimization tool which enables every new generation of individuals to be better equipped with its ever changing environment. Biological Systems also offer us better physical designs suited for the environment and the task required to be performed. Here, we attempted to train a [Hexapod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapod_(robotics)) to walk in a straight line using [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), a class of [Evolutionary Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm).
# Getting Started
A neurally controlled [Hexapod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexapod_(robotics)) was built using [Pyrosim](https://ccappelle.github.io/pyrosim/index.html), a Python library. [Pyrosim](https://ccappelle.github.io/pyrosim/index.html) provides a detailed description of how to generate the body of the robot equipped with sensors required and create a [ANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) architecture required to control it. The weights of the neural architecture are modified using [pyeasyga](https://pypi.org/project/pyeasyga/), another python library. These are needed to be installed along with their dependencies. 
# Overview
The weights(https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/weight-artificial-neural-network) of the neural architecture are initialized randomly and is optimized using Genetic Algorithm through provided fitness function. The data required to evaluate the fitness of a chromosome is collected using the sensors provided. 
# Challenges
The fitness function required for the convergence of the algorithm quickly is determined heuristically. The optimization problem is of very high dimensions and its dimensionality increases sharply with a minimum increase in number of neurons in the control architecture. 
# Future Scope
Hexapod was able to walk in a straight line. But a [tripod gait](https://insectsandrobots.weebly.com/tripod-gait.html) was not obtained which is generally observed in the biological systems. Every aspect of the robot including the dimensions of its limbs along with the fitness function and architecture are to be tweeked to achieve tripod gait.
